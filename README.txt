Imports records from netforum to a wordpress database.

== Description ==

Contributed by fusionSpan (www.fusionspan.com). This plugin creates a table in the wordpress database that contains commonly
used fields in netforum. It also comes with a GUI to make it easier to import data from netforum to wordpress.
It also gives you the option to display the netforum data on any page by using the shortcode [member_tables].

The optional fields of the shortcode are:

- limit eg. [member_tables limit=50] which limits the number of records that will be
displayed. The default is to show all.

- display_members_only eg. [member_tables display_members_only=1]. This takes either 1 or 0 with 1 meaning only records for which the
Customer Member Flag or Receive Benefits Flag is true, will be displayed, or 0 which means all records will be displayed. The default is 0

- display_fields eg. [member_tables display_fields="first name, last name, email"]. This can be used to specify which fields are shown in
the table, and in which order they should be shown. The defalt is display_fields="first name, last name, title, email, city, state".
The valid options are:
   - first name
   - last name
   - middle name
   - title
   - email
   - city
   - state
   - address1
   - address2
   - address3
   - country
   - organization

The shortcode fields can be used together eg. [member_tables limit=50 display_members_only=1 display_fields="first name, email"] will
display 50 records whose member flag is set to true and will list only the first name and email in the table generated by this shortcode.

It should also be noted that if the do_not_display_online flag is 1, those records will not be displayed with this shortcode.

We also have an additional sync utility that adds more functionality syncs the data periodically with data pulled from netforum.
Contact support@fusionspan.com for more information.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I drag Customer Key, Customer Member Flag or Receive Benefits Flag to the unused box in the import screen? =

Some of our other plugins require these fields in order to work correctly, therefore to ensure compatablilty with those plugins, 
they are required fields.
