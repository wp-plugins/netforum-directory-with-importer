== Description ==

Contributed by fusionSpan (www.fusionspan.com). Displays a member directory on any page on the wordpress site with
the shortcode [member_tables].
It also comes with a GUI to make it easier to import data from netforum to wordpress. 

You can specify the fields you want shown with [member_tables display_fields="*fields here*"]. Supported fields are
   - first name
   - last name
   - middle name
   - title
   - email
   - city
   - state
   - address1
   - address2
   - address3
   - country
   - organization

We also have an additional sync utility that adds more functionality syncs the data periodically with data pulled from netforum.
Contact support@fusionspan.com for more information.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the `fs-netforum-directory-with-importer.zip` into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The import page is called FS Netforum Import located under "Tools" in the admin menu.

To import your existing data from netforum. Export it from netForum in csv format click on Import Netforum Data in the plugin menu and 
follow the instructions there. NOTE: The customer key field is a required field since some of our other plugins make use of it.

Using shortcodes:

The member's table can be displayed by using the shortcode [member_tables] on any page. 

The optional fields of the shortcode are:

- limit eg. [member_tables limit=50] which limits the number of records that will be
displayed. The default is to show all.

- display_members_only eg. [member_tables display_members_only=1]. This takes either 1 or 0 with 1 meaning only records for which the
Customer Member Flag or Receive Benefits Flag is true, will be displayed, or 0 which means all records will be displayed. The default is 0

- display_fields eg. [member_tables display_fields="first name, last name, email"]. This can be used to specify which fields are shown in
the table, and in which order they should be shown. The default is display_fields="first name, last name, title, email, city, state".
The valid options are:
   - first name
   - last name
   - middle name
   - title
   - email
   - city
   - state
   - address1
   - address2
   - address3
   - country
   - organization

The shortcode fields can be used together eg. [member_tables limit=50 display_members_only=1 display_fields="first name, email"] will
display 50 records whose member flag is set to true and will list only the first name and email in the table generated by this shortcode.

It should also be noted that if the do_not_display_online flag is 1, those records will not be displayed with this shortcode.
 
 
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I drag Customer Key, Customer Member Flag or Receive Benefits Flag to the unused box in the import screen? =

Some of our other plugins require these fields in order to work correctly, therefore to ensure compatablilty with those plugins, 
they are required fields.
